Computer 301 Assignment 1
TravelClaim App
===
This app that allows you to keep track of your travels and the expenses occured during your travels.
Some functions include adding, deleting, editing your claims and expenses, and calculate the total cost
occured during you travels. This app will allow you to email such claims and expenses to yourself or others, but unfortunately this early version of the app cannot email just yet. Some bugs include not being able to see your expense list items and closing the app will lose all previous data.
